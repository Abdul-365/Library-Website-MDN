# Library-Website-MDN
A local library website made with the help of a tutorial from MDN website - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website

Making this website helped me learn about the basics of backend development. The languages and frameworks I used were Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB database.

This website has a simple front-end as the main focus of the tutorial was to teach back-end. I learnt about rendering data from database, making Schemas, routes, controllers, etc. I also learnt how to validate data submitted in a form through Express Validator and modify records in the database through user's requests.
